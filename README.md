# Iris-Flower-Classification-Using-Multiple-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
This repository contains an implementation of various machine learning algorithms to classify Iris flowers into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica. The project demonstrates the use of different classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, and Random Forest, using the Iris dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and cross-validation.

# Features
